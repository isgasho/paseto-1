Package paseto implements [PASETO](https://paseto.io/) v2.local. (Contributions of v2.public would be welcome.)

It has NOT been reviewed by a cryptographer.
Use at your own risk.

It is not v1.0 yet because there is an open question about the API: Should it accept a `*[32]byte` key or a `[]byte` key?
